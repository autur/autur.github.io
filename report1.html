    <p>Thank you for completing my survey!</p>
    <p style="width: 1132px;">As part of the survey, you completed the Big Five
      Aspect Scale, a measure of the five major dimensions of personality and
      their aspects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Openness/Intellect</strong>: Openness and Intellect</li>
      <li><strong>Conscientiousness</strong>: Industriousness and Orderliness</li>
      <li style="width: 1249px;"><strong>Agreeableness</strong>: Compassion and
        Politeness</li>
      <li><strong>Extraversion</strong>: Enthusiasm and Assertiveness</li>
      <li><strong>Neuroticism</strong>: Withdrawal and Volatility</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In this report, you will find your rankings on these traits, along with
      descriptions of each trait, its advantages and disadvantages, and the
      average differences in personality between men and women. The rankings are
      in the form of percentiles, ranging from 0 to 100, which indicate how you
      rank on any given personality trait compared to other individuals from the
      general US population (i.e., people of all ages, sexes, ethnicities,
      etc.). </p>
    <p>To help you understand how to interpret your percentile scores, imagine
      that you are in a room with 100 random individuals and we rank order
      everyone according to their score on trait X. If you score in the 60<sup>th</sup>
      percentile on that trait, it means that you would be higher on the trait
      than 59 of the individuals in the room, and conversely you would be lower
      on the trait than 40 of them. The higher your percentile score is, the
      more you exhibit the trait relative to other people.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that each personality trait and aspect (and your relative
      position with respect to them) has advantages and disadvantages. It is for
      that reason that variation exists in the human population: there is a
      niche for each personality configuration. Much of what constitutes success
      in life is therefore the consequence of finding the place in
      relationships, work and personal commitment that corresponds to your
      unique personality structure</p>
    <p>Also note that your scores can be somewhat influenced by the state of
      mind you were in as you took the survey, particularly how well you were
      paying attention and responded thoughtfully to each question, and how
      moody and self-critical you were.</p>
    <p>If you find that many of your scores are in the extreme ranges (0s and
      90s), this may be due to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_bias#Extreme_responding">extreme
        responding bias</a>, which means that you used the 'strongly agree' and
      'strongly disagree' options much more frequently than others did. On the
      other hand, many people show the opposite bias of almost never using the
      extreme options (e.g., using only 'agree' and 'disagree') and that is also
      less than ideal.</p>
    <p>There are also cultural differences in response styles, which may be
      especially relevant to you if you come from a non-Western culture. <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.331.9667&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">This
        article</a>, for example, provides an explanation for why East Asian
      individuals show a more moderate response style than Westerners. And <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057740816300213">this
        recent article</a> provides an explanation for why people from
      individualist cultures respond more extremely than those from collectivist
      cultures.</p>
    <p>After reading this report, you may find yourself asking, "OK, so what do
      these scores mean?". The short and simple answer is that you should regard
      this report as an opportunity to learn more about yourself. Most people
      are able to describe their personality in some detail but have only a
      vague sense of how they compare to other individuals. Having this kind of
      information can help you form more a more accurate model of the average
      personality and your relation to it. Speaking more broadly, the more you
      know about yourself and the more accurate your self-knowledge, the better
      you'll be at (1) making choices that are congruent with your personality,
      and (2) identifying dysfunctional patterns of behavior that you may want
      to change.</p>

    <h3>Openness/Intellect: <span style="color: #999999;">${e://Field/O_level}</span>
      (${e://Field/O_prank} percentile)</h3>
    <p>You are ${e://Field/O_level} in Openness/Intellect, which describes
      individual differences in cognitive exploration, the tendency to seek,
      detect, appreciate, understand, and utilize both sensory and abstract
      information. Openness/Intellect includes interest in art, literature,
      fantasy, philosophy, abstract thinking as well as sensitivity to aesthetic
      emotions and beauty.</p>
    <p>The two aspects of this dimension, Intellect and Openness, are described
      below.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Intellect: <span style="color: #808080;">${e://Field/Oi_level}</span></strong>
      (${e://Field/Oi_prank} percentile)</p>
    <p>Intellect reflects the degree to which a person seeks abstract
      information, creates causal explanations of that information, and then
      uses those explanations to think. In other words, people high in Intellect
      spend more time learning, analyzing, and reasoning about the world. As a
      result, their cognitive representations of things tend to be more nuanced
      and complex, making it easier for them to generate better ways to
      accomplish their goals. People high in Intellect are often described by
      their peers as intelligent, curious, and analytical. For this aspect, you
      scored at the ${e://Field/Oi_prank} percentile.</p>
    <p>Women are lower than men in Intellect (although not in IQ). This probably
      reflects a difference in interests: people high in Intellect, compared to
      Openness, are more likely to prefer the sciences to the arts. The mean
      percentile for women in a general population (women and men) is 45. For
      men it is 55.</p>
    <p>Advantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fluency with complex systems, abstraction, and logic</li>
      <li>Seeks and digests large amounts of information rapidly; quick learner</li>
      <li>Recognizes higher-order patterns and forms multi-causal explanations</li>
      <li>Achievement in STEM fields; ingenuity with concepts and strategies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Disadvantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Adds needless complexity; abstracts away essential contextual factors</li>
      <li>Discounts tacit knowledge; values information for information's sake</li>
      <li>Susceptible to confirmation bias; can form sophisticated
        rationalizations</li>
      <li>Can be perceived as intellectually arrogant</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Openness: <span style="color: #808080;">${e://Field/Oo_level}</span></strong>
      (${e://Field/Oo_prank} percentile)</p>
    <p>Openness reflects the degree to which a person seeks new sensory
      experiences, detects patterns in those experiences, and then creates novel
      things from that information. As such, people high in Openness tend to be
      imaginative, reflective, and interested in aesthetics. In fact, studies
      show that high Openness strongly predicts creative achievement in the
      arts. Individuals who score high in Openness are often described by their
      peers as liberal-minded, perceptive, and cultured. For this aspect, you
      scored at the ${e://Field/Oo_prank} percentile.</p>
    <p>Women are higher in Openness than men. The mean percentile for women in a
      general population (women and men) is 56.5. For men it is 44.5.</p>
    <p>Advantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Seeks and considers alternative perspectives; self-reflective</li>
      <li>Fluent in divergent thinking; able to create new and useful things</li>
      <li>Exploratory; knowledgeable about a wide variety of events and
        experiences</li>
      <li>Sophisticated taste; aptitude for arts, design, and creative
        disciplines</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Disadvantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Makes spurious connections; drawn to eccentric ideas and grand
        theories</li>
      <li>Needless innovation; irrational desire for change; disrupts existing
        practices</li>
      <li>Bored with routine and repetitive tasks; knows a little about many
        different topics</li>
      <li>Dismisses the tested and traditional; prejudiced towards the novel and
        unique</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Conscientiousness: <span style="color: #808080;">${e://Field/C_level}</span>
      (${e://Field/C_prank} percentile)</h3>
    <p>You are ${e://Field/C_level} in Conscientiousness, which represents the
      general ability to work towards achieving non-immediate goals. As a broad
      personality dimension, Conscientiousness includes tendencies such as
      dutifulness, self-discipline, attention to detail, ambition, persistence,
      cleanliness, efficiency and adherence to rules, standards and processes.
      Conscientious people implement their plans and establish and maintain
      order.</p>
    <p>Conscientiousness has two aspects, Industriousness and Orderliness,
      described below.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Industriousness: <span style="color: #808080;">${e://Field/Ci_level}</span></strong>
      (${e://Field/Ci_prank} percentile)</p>
    <p>Industriousness reflects the degree to which a person regulates their
      impulses and resists those distractions that might prevent them from
      reaching their long-term goals. People high in Industriousness stay
      motivated, focusing intensely on completing those tasks relevant to their
      future plans. As a result, they are efficient in their pursuits and
      regularly accomplish what they set out to do. Those high in
      Industriousness are often described by their peers as self-disciplined,
      hard-working, and goal-oriented. For this aspect, you scored at the
      ${e://Field/Ci_prank} percentile.</p>
    <p>Men are slightly more industrious than women. The mean percentile for men
      in a general population (women and men) is 51.5. For women it is 49.5.</p>
    <p>Advantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Controls impulses and ignores distractions; able to delay
        gratification</li>
      <li>Does not waste time (procrastinate); able get down to work quickly</li>
      <li>Persistent in achieving their objectives; confident in their abilities
        and productivity</li>
      <li>Prioritizes actions well; completes tasks efficiently and effectively</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Disadvantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hyper-focused on existing plan; ignores better opportunities as
        distractions</li>
      <li>Mistakes activity for productivity; fails to pause to reflect or
        reconsider objectives</li>
      <li>Poor at balancing work and leisure; workaholic</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Orderliness: <span style="color: #808080;">${e://Field/Co_level}</span></strong>
      (${e://Field/Co_prank} percentile)</p>
    <p>Orderliness reflects the degree to which a person maintains organization
      in both their personal spaces and their daily activities. People high in
      Orderliness tend to organize their behavior by establishing clear rules or
      guidelines (including schedules), set either by themselves or by others,
      and they are careful to operate within these guidelines. For this aspect,
      you scored at the ${e://Field/Co_prank} percentile.</p>
    <p>Women are more orderly than men. The mean percentile for women in a
      general population (women and men) is 54.5. For men it is 45.5. This may
      account for some of the differences in the share of housework between
      women and men. Since women are, on average, more orderly, household
      disorder will trigger disgust and discomfort in them faster. This may
      happen with sufficient frequency so they end up doing a disproportionate
      share of such work (even though if they waited a bit longer their less
      orderly partners, often men, might end up equally troubled and motivated
      to fix the problem). Orderly people are more likely to have items such as
      event calendars, drawer organizers, laundry baskets, irons and ironing
      boards in their immediate environments.</p>
    <p>Advantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Meticulous about schedules and policies; reliably follows procedure</li>
      <li>Consistently fulfills their responsibilities to family, community, and
        work</li>
      <li>Cautious and prudent; careful to avoid mistakes and risky situations</li>
      <li>Respectful of rank and position; loyal to trusted organizations and
        systems</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Disadvantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Difficulty adapting to changes or novel situations; desires clear
        directives</li>
      <li>Rigid with respect to rules and schedules; unwilling to deviate from
        them</li>
      <li>Loses sight of the big picture; too much attention to detail and
        concern over making errors</li>
      <li>Conforms to others' expectations; does not always think independently</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Agreeableness: <span style="color: #808080;">${e://Field/A_level}</span>
      (${e://Field/A_prank} percentile)</h3>
    <p>You are ${e://Field/A_level} in Agreeableness, which represents the
      general tendency toward social harmony, as opposed to exploitation and
      lack of concern for others. As a relatively broad dimension, Agreeableness
      includes modesty, honesty, empathy, cooperation, trust, and
      tender-mindedness.</p>
    <p>Women are higher in Agreeableness than men. The mean percentile for women
      in a general population (women and men) is 61.5. For men it is 38.5. The
      fact that men are lower in Agreeableness than women helps explain their
      much higher rates of criminal incarceration (90% male). The primary
      difference between criminals and non-criminals is disagreeableness. If the
      typical criminal is more disagreeable than 98% of people in the general
      population, then almost all those criminals will be male. This difference
      in Agreeableness between men and women is largest in countries such as
      Norway and Sweden, where the most has been done to ensure equality of
      outcome between the sexes. This provides strong evidence that biological
      factors rather than environment and learning account for the
      dissimilarity.</p>
    <p>Agreeableness has two aspects, Politeness and Compassion, described
      below.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Politeness: <span style="color: #808080;">${e://Field/Ap_level}</span></strong>
      (${e://Field/Ap_prank} percentile)</p>
    <p>Politeness reflects the degree to which a person suppresses aggressive or
      selfish impulses that might hinder cooperative interactions with other
      people. Not only do people high in Politeness avoid violating social
      norms, they also restrain themselves out of consideration for other
      people's needs and desires, often seeing little reason for conflict. As a
      result, they tend to be described by their peers as considerate, modest,
      and altruistic. For this aspect, you scored at the ${e://Field/Ap_prank}
      percentile.</p>
    <p>Women are higher in Politeness than men. The mean percentile for women in
      a general population (women and men) is 59. For men it is 41.</p>
    <p>Advantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cooperative with others; respects people's preferences; good teammate</li>
      <li>Speaks carefully to maintain relational rapport; defers to authority</li>
      <li>Makes sacrifices to support others; encourages and assists people's
        efforts</li>
      <li>Navigates different cultures and norms well; very appropriate and
        unassuming</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Disadvantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Taken advantage of by other people; easily steamrolled; poor
        negotiators</li>
      <li>Avoids necessary confrontations; maintains the status quo; passive
        aggressive</li>
      <li>Dependent on the approval of other people; reluctant to promote
        oneself</li>
      <li>Seeks consensus; prone to slow, bureaucratic decision-making</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Compassion: <span style="color: #808080;">${e://Field/Ac_level}</span></strong>
      (${e://Field/Ac_prank} percentile)</p>
    <p>Compassion reflects the degree to which a person responds and relates to
      the emotions of others. People high in Compassion seem to experience
      certain involuntary emotions like empathy with more intensity and
      frequency. As such, they tend to seek intimate relationships by expressing
      their emotions and relating to others as they do the same. People high in
      Compassion are often described by their peers as sympathetic, tender, and
      kind-hearted. For this aspect, you scored at the ${e://Field/Ac_prank}
      percentile.</p>
    <p>Women are also higher in Compassion than men. The mean percentile for
      women in a general population (women and men) is 61. For men it is 39</p>
    <p>Advantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Aware of the needs of other people, especially those in pain or
        vulnerable</li>
      <li>Responsive to the emotions of others; interested in sharing and
        relating</li>
      <li>Understanding and accepting; not quick to dismiss other people's
        experiences</li>
      <li>Trusts others' intentions; optimistic about people's potential growth</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Disadvantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Struggles to consistently enforce rules; finds exceptions to avoid
        confrontations</li>
      <li>Trusts emotions to a fault; unreflective about their merit or
        legitimacy</li>
      <li>Overly sensitive and protective; ignores the value of overcoming
        adversity</li>
      <li>Susceptible to emotional appeals and manipulation; naive and trusting</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Extraversion: <span style="color: #808080;">${e://Field/E_level}</span>
      (${e://Field/E_prank} percentile)</h3>
    <p>You are ${e://Field/E_level} in Extraversion, which reflects your
      sensitivity to reward and reward-related positive emotions such as hope,
      joy, anticipation, and eagerness. Extraversion has two aspects,
      Assertiveness and Enthusiasm, described below.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Assertiveness: <span style="color: #808080;">${e://Field/Ea_level}</span></strong>
      (${e://Field/Ea_prank} percentile)</p>
    <p>Assertiveness reflects the degree to which a person is
      'approach-oriented,' that is, driven to attain social status, influence,
      or other human rewards. People high in Assertiveness are more motivated by
      the possibility of achieving their goals than others; thus they are more
      active and bold in pursuing them. Unsurprisingly, the peers of people high
      in Assertiveness often describe them as intense, decisive, and confident.
      For this aspect, you scored at the ${e://Field/Ea_prank} percentile.</p>
    <p>Women are slightly less assertive than men. The mean percentile for women
      in a general population (women and men) is 48. For men it is 52.</p>
    <p>Advantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Aptitude for leadership or advancing upward in status hierarchies</li>
      <li>Action-oriented, always pursuing some venture; intense and energetic</li>
      <li>The first to act or speak up in a group; confident, direct, and bold</li>
      <li>Accomplishes things by force of will; influences people; removes
        obstacles</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Disadvantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Alienates people by overstepping personal boundaries or norms;
        controlling</li>
      <li>Unjustified confidence; unaware of own limits; slow to recognize their
        disadvantages</li>
      <li>Dominates meetings and teams; ignores thoughtful yet less aggressive
        peers</li>
      <li>Cuts themselves off from feedback; impulsive, doesn't pause to reflect</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Enthusiasm: <span style="color: #808080;">${e://Field/Ee_level}</span></strong>
      (${e://Field/Ee_prank} percentile)</p>
    <p>Enthusiasm reflects the degree to which a person experiences positive
      emotion upon attaining a reward. All things being equal, a person high in
      Enthusiasm simply enjoys things more. Because most human rewards involve
      other people, they often appear sociable and cheerful but their positive
      emotionality extends to all domains. People high in Enthusiasm are often
      described by their peers as gregarious, exuberant, and fun-loving. For
      this aspect, you scored at the ${e://Field/Ee_prank} percentile.</p>
    <p>Women are higher in Enthusiasm than men. The mean percentile for women in
      a general population (women and men) is 55. For men it is 45.</p>
    <p>Advantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Experiences positive emotions with more intensity and frequency;
        excitable</li>
      <li>Initiates social interactions; puts people at ease; generally sociable</li>
      <li>Sees the best in things and inspires others to do the same; encourages
        people</li>
      <li>Builds a large group of friends; maintains strong social support
        networks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Disadvantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Seeks attention for attention's sake; can become exhibitionistic or
        histrionic</li>
      <li>Prefers large crowds and loud parties over focused, 1-on-1
        conversations</li>
      <li>Overly optimistic; focuses more on upsides than potential downsides</li>
      <li>Spends less time alone, thinking, reflecting, reading; conventional</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Neuroticism: <span style="color: #808080;">${e://Field/N_level}</span>
      (${e://Field/N_prank} percentile)</h3>
    <p>You are ${e://Field/N_level} in Neuroticism, which reflects your
      sensitivity to threat and punishment, as well as your tendency to
      experience negative emotions such as pain, sadness, irritable or defensive
      anger, fear, and anxiety.</p>
    <p>Females tend to be higher in Neuroticism than males. The average woman is
      higher in Neuroticism than 60% of the general population of men and women
      combined. In part, this may be why women report more unhappiness in their
      relationships, at work, in school and with their health than men, on
      average, and why women initiate 70% of all divorces. This difference in
      Neuroticism between men and women appears to emerge at puberty.</p>
    <p>Neuroticism has two aspects, Volatility and Withdrawal, described below.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Volatility: <span style="color: #808080;">${e://Field/Nv_level}</span></strong>
      (${e://Field/Nv_prank} percentile)</p>
    <p>Volatility reflects the degree to which a person easily gets upset,
      angry, irritated, or panicky. Generally speaking, people high in
      Volatility experience more negative emotion when confronted with danger or
      punishment. You might say they have more of an inclination to "fight,
      flight, or freeze" when facing an undesirable situation. People low in
      Volatility are often described by their peers as calm, unflappable, and
      level-headed. For this aspect, you scored at the ${e://Field/Nv_prank}
      percentile.</p>
    <p>Women are higher in Volatility than men. The mean percentile for women in
      a general population (women and men) is 57.5. For men it is 42.5.</p>
    <p>Individuals who score <u>low</u> in Volatility:</p>
    <p>Advantages</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Perseveres through unexpected setbacks and failures</li>
      <li>Not defensive or easily upset; tolerant of criticism; accepts negative
        feedback</li>
      <li>Doesn't quickly swing from emotional highs and lows; not moody or
        volatile</li>
      <li>Not reactive; doesn't panic or get frustrated when things don't work
        out</li>

    <p><strong>Withdrawal: <span style="color: #808080;">${e://Field/Nw_level}</span></strong>
      (${e://Field/Nw_prank} percentile)</p>
    <p>Withdrawal reflects the degree to which a person struggles with
      depressive or anxious thoughts. While people low in Withdrawal tolerate
      stress well and bounce back after adversity, those higher in Withdrawal
      are generally more vulnerable. Because they tend to internalize problems
      in their lives, people high in Withdrawal experience anxious or depressive
      episodes with more frequency. People low in Withdrawal are often described
      by their peers as hardy and resilient. For this aspect, you scored at the
      ${e://Field/Nw_prank} percentile.</p>
    <p>Women are higher in Withdrawal than men. The mean percentile for women in
      a general population (women and men) is 60. For men it is 40.</p>
